## To access the whole of the gcc-6.2 suite of compilers, add the
## following lines to your $HOME/.bash_profile:

PATH=/stratt/vale/local/bin:/stratt/vale/toor/gcc62/bin:/stratt/vale/toor/bin:$PATH
export PATH

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/stratt/vale/toor/lib:/stratt/vale/toor/lib64:/stratt/vale/toor/gcc62/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## now gcc-6.2, g++-6.2, etc will be available in your path

## When compiling, use the following flags:
# -I/stratt/vale/toor/include -L/stratt/vale/toor/lib

## When submitting jobs, you may need to add the following flag to
## qsub or to your submit script:
